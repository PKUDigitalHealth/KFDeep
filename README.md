# KFDeep

### Introduction

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper *Development and Validation of a Dynamic Kidney Failure Prediction Model based on Deep Learning: A Real-World Study with External Validation*.

### Getting Started

- run `src.py` to train the model
- `demo` folder contains a PyTorch-free deployment for directly calculating an individual patient's risk of kidney failure.
